# Spec-Driven Development System Guide

Comprehensive system overview for AI agents in structured software development.

## Purpose
AI agent system for structured development: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity Before Code**: Understanding precedes implementation, enhanced through conceptual exploration
   - **Benefits**: Reduce uncertainty, minimize rework, build the right thing correctly, discover better possibilities
   - **AI Impact**: Enables AI agents to understand and expand on requirements through proactive conceptualization

2. **Iterative Refinement**: Each phase builds on validated foundations with explicit approval gates
   - **Benefits**: Early issue detection, solid phase progression, quality assurance
   - **AI Impact**: Structured approval workflow prevents AI agents from proceeding with flawed specs

3. **Clean Documentation**: Focused, actionable content enables effective collaboration
   - **Benefits**: Clear communication, reduced overhead, better focus
   - **AI Impact**: Streamlined content allows AI agents to focus on implementation rather than parsing complex structures

4. **Manageable Complexity**: Complex systems are best understood and built through systematic decomposition
   - **Benefits**: Reduced cognitive load, clearer dependencies, manageable implementation steps
   - **AI Impact**: Enables AI agents to handle enterprise-level complexity through structured breakdown

*See backbone axioms for operational application of these philosophical foundations*

## System Rules

1. **Three-Phase Process**: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation
2. **User Approval**: Explicit approval required between phases
3. **EARS Format**: `WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]`
4. **Sub-Specifications**: Break complex features into manageable parts
5. **Direct Implementation**: Simple file creation and editing

## Philosophy

**Human-AI Collaboration**: AI agents provide comprehensive analysis and implementation while humans guide decisions and validate outcomes. This partnership leverages AI capabilities for systematic execution while preserving human judgment for strategic direction and quality control.

## Key Formats
- **EARS**: `WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]`
- **Tasks**: Hierarchical with optional tasks marked "*"
- **Design Decisions**: Options considered, rationale, impact, requirements addressed

*See `patterns.md` for complete format examples and templates*

## AI Agent Collaboration

### Human-AI Workflow
1. **Human**: Provides feature idea and context
2. **AI Agent**: Generates structured requirements with comprehensive summaries
3. **Human**: Reviews and approves requirements
4. **AI Agent**: Creates technical design with clear decisions and rationale
5. **Human**: Validates design approach
6. **AI Agent**: Breaks down implementation into hierarchical tasks
7. **Human**: Selects tasks for execution
8. **AI Agent**: Implements tasks with context loading and detailed summaries

### AI Agent Benefits
- **Clear Context**: Requirements, design, and tasks provide comprehensive context
- **Focused Content**: Clean documentation without excessive overhead
- **Systematic Approach**: Structured phases with clear approval gates
- **Comprehensive Summaries**: Detailed explanations of approach and rationale

## Quality Standards
- **EARS format** for acceptance criteria
- **Requirement traceability** through all phases
- **User approval** at phase boundaries
- **Hierarchical task structure** with clear dependencies
- **Comprehensive summaries** explaining approach and rationale

## Core Files
- **`patterns.md`** - Document structure patterns and templates
- **`process.md`** - Complete workflow and communication guidance
- **`templates/`** - Document templates for consistent creation

## Key Features
- **Context Efficient**: Streamlined for AI agent consumption
- **Clean Documentation**: Focused, actionable content
- **Hierarchical Tasks**: Clear implementation structure
- **Human Validation**: User approval over automated metrics
- **Quality Focused**: Essential information without bloat
- **Cross-Platform**: Works across different development environments
- **Template-Based**: Consistent document creation with established patterns

## Best Practices
**Adoption**: Start simple, use templates, iterate based on feedback
**Common Pitfalls**: Skipping approval gates, incomplete requirements, missing traceability, inconsistent formats
*See `.yask/process.md` for detailed troubleshooting and error recovery strategies*

## Usage Guidelines
1. Load this overview for complete system context and principles
2. Reference `patterns.md` for document creation and templates
3. Reference `process.md` for detailed workflow and communication guidance
4. Use `templates/` for actual template files
5. Follow the three-phase process with explicit approval gates

## Troubleshooting

### AI Agent Issues
**Symptoms**: AI generates incorrect or inconsistent specifications
**Solutions**:
- Provide clear, specific prompts referencing this methodology
- Use structured prompting patterns from process guide
- Reference templates for expected output format
- Break complex requests into smaller, focused tasks

### Approval Workflow Issues
**Symptoms**: Unclear approval status or skipped approvals
**Solutions**:
- Use flexible approval language adapted to circumstances
- Wait for explicit approval ("yes", "approved", "looks good")
- Ensure comprehensive summaries are provided at each phase

### Document Quality Issues
**Symptoms**: Inconsistent or incomplete specifications
**Solutions**:
- Use templates and established patterns
- Ensure EARS format compliance in requirements
- Verify cross-references between documents
- Focus on actionable, clear content
